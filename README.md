Work for UTSA, by Derek M. <br />
I am a proud supporter of the Linux kernel and Linus Torvald's work. My favorite language to hear about is Rust. <br />
My favorite programming language currently is Python 3, this is because of how easy it is to write and how the syntax just makes sense. <br />
I also love the consept of Open Source and how it can benefit the world through collaboration.
